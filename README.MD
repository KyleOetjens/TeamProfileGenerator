# Team Profile Generator

## Description  

I created a team profile generator to practice OOP and dive more in to inquirer.  To use this application, simply run node index.js and answer the prompts, you can add as many employees as you want.  Once you are done, the index.html file will be in the dist folder to be viewed.
